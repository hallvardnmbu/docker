# VPN Script Consolidation and CLI Tool Update - Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Created Centralized VPN Directory
- **Location**: `/vpn/` in project root
- **Structure**:
  ```
  vpn/
  ├── scripts/          # Consolidated VPN utility scripts
  │   ├── start-vpn.sh      # Unified VPN startup (replaces 3 scripts)
  │   ├── killswitch.sh     # Unified firewall killswitch (replaces 2 scripts)
  │   ├── health-check.sh   # Unified health check (replaces 2 scripts)  
  │   └── setup-vpn.sh      # Unified VPN setup (replaces 2 scripts)
  ├── config/           # Configuration templates
  │   └── nordvpn.ovpn.template
  └── README.md         # Documentation
  ```

### 2. ✅ Eliminated Script Redundancy
**Removed 9 redundant VPN scripts:**
- `docker/common/scripts/start-vpn-base.sh`
- `docker/common/scripts/start-vpn-torrenting.sh`
- `docker/common/scripts/start-vpn-javascript.sh`
- `docker/common/scripts/killswitch.sh`
- `docker/common/scripts/health-check.sh`
- `torrenting/scripts/start-vpn.sh`
- `torrenting/scripts/killswitch.sh`
- `torrenting/scripts/health-check.sh`
- `javascript/scripts/start-vpn.sh`
- `javascript/scripts/killswitch.sh`
- `javascript/scripts/health-check.sh`
- `javascript/setup-vpn.sh`

**Consolidated into 4 unified scripts:**
- `vpn/scripts/start-vpn.sh` - Accepts service type parameter
- `vpn/scripts/killswitch.sh` - Configurable for different services
- `vpn/scripts/health-check.sh` - Service-aware health checking
- `vpn/scripts/setup-vpn.sh` - Interactive setup for any service

### 3. ✅ Updated Docker Configurations
**Torrenting Dockerfile:**
- Now uses centralized VPN scripts from `../vpn/scripts/`
- Passes `torrenting` service type to start script
- Removed references to old distributed scripts

**JavaScript Dockerfile:**
- Now uses centralized VPN scripts from `../vpn/scripts/`
- Passes `javascript` service type to start script
- Removed references to old distributed scripts

### 4. ✅ Enhanced CLI Tool (`doc.rs`)
**Merged Commands:**
- Combined `init` and `setup` into single `setup` command
- `doc setup` - Configure project root only
- `doc setup torrenting` - Setup project + torrenting service
- `doc setup javascript` - Setup project + javascript service

**New VPN Commands:**
- `doc vpn-check <service>` - Verify VPN connection
- `doc killswitch-check <service>` - Verify killswitch configuration
- `doc status <service>` - Now supports both torrenting and javascript
- `doc test <service>` - Now supports both torrenting and javascript

**Updated Functionality:**
- Uses centralized `vpn/scripts/setup-vpn.sh` 
- Only needs to be run once per service
- Supports both torrenting and javascript services
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 5. ✅ Improved Script Features
**Service-Type Aware:**
- All scripts accept service type as parameter
- Torrenting: Configures qBittorrent ports (8081)
- JavaScript: Configures dev server ports (3000, 5173, 8080)
- Default: Basic VPN without service-specific ports

**Better Security:**
- Unified killswitch with proper service isolation
- Configurable Docker subnets
- Enhanced traffic leak prevention
- Secure file permissions for credentials

**Enhanced Monitoring:**
- Service-specific health checks
- Better VPN connection verification
- Improved logging and debugging
- Traffic leak detection

## Usage Examples

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Setup project root and torrenting service
doc setup torrenting

# Setup project root and javascript service  
doc setup javascript

# Setup project root only
doc setup
```

### Container Management
```bash
# Start services
doc start torrenting
doc start javascript

# Check status with VPN verification
doc status torrenting
doc status javascript

# Run comprehensive tests
doc test torrenting
doc test javascript
```

### VPN-Specific Commands
```bash
# Quick VPN connection check
doc vpn-check torrenting
doc vpn-check javascript

# Verify killswitch configuration
doc killswitch-check torrenting
doc killswitch-check javascript
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Maintenance**: 12 scripts → 4 scripts (67% reduction)
2. **Single Source of Truth**: All VPN logic centralized
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Enhanced CLI**: More intuitive commands, better error handling
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Same VPN logic across all services
6. **Easier Updates**: Changes only need to be made in one place
7. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive README and usage examples

## Migration Notes

- Old VPN scripts have been removed - containers must be rebuilt
- CLI commands changed: `doc init` + `doc setup` → `doc setup [service]`  
- New VPN directory must be present in project root
- Docker build context updated to include `../vpn/scripts/`
